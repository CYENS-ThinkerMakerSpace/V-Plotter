# V-Plotter
A machine that can draw images on large surfaces.

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 4B and an ESP-32 microcontroller to give Thinker Maker Space team the ability to draw large images intricately and innovatively.

The project is based on a computer numerical control system developed and tested in-house by our technicians. It includes translating an image into a path sequence that is then reconverted into the rotational positioning of two stepper motors.
